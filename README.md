- Activity 3: Formatting text with escape characters (\n, \t, \\, \"). [activity3.py](activity3.py)
- Activity 4: Counting the number of characters in a string with len(). [activity4.py](activity4.py)
- Activity 5: Identifying the data type of a value using type(). [activity5.py](activity5.py)
- Activity 6: Performing basic arithmetic operations in Python. [activity6.py](activity6.py)
- Activity 7: Using assignment operators to update variable values. [activity7.py](activity7.py)
- Activity 8: Comparing values with comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=). [activity8.py](activity8.py)
- Activity 9: Combining conditions using logical operators (and, or, not). [activity9.py](activity9.py)
- Activity 10: The use of conditional statements (if, elif, else) in Python. [activity10.py](activity10.py)
- Activity 11: Continuation of the use of conditional stament(exercises). [activity11.py](activity11.py)
- Activity 12: Introduction to for loop (start,stop,step). [activity12.py](activity12.py)
- Activity 13: Compute the sum of 10 user-inputted numbers using a for loop. [activity13.py](activity13.py)
- Activity 14: Display numbers from 20 down to 1 using a reverse for loop. [activity14.py](activity14.py)
- Activity 15: Input 10 numbers and find the sum of all odd numbers. [activity15.py](activity15.py)
- Activity 16: Print numbers from 1 to 10 in a single line. [activity16.py](activity16.py)
- Activity 17: Display a number grid (1–10) using nested loops. [activity17.py](activity17.py)
- Activity 18: Print a right-angled triangle of numbers using nested loops. [activity18.py](activity18.py)
- Activity 19: Display a right-angled triangle pattern using *. [activity19.py](activity19.py)
- Activity 20: Display an inverted right-angled triangle pattern using *. [activity20.py](activity20.py)
- Activity 21: Use a while loop to simulate washing continuation with user confirmation. [activity21.py](activity21.py)
- Activity 22: Guess-the-number game using while loop and random. [activity22.py](activity22.py)
- Activity 23: Perform list operations (append, pop, remove, insert, sort, iterate, slice). [activity23.py](activity23.py)
- Activity 24: I learned how to define functions with def and import everything from another file using from filename import *. [activity24.py](activity24.py)
- Activity 25: Import functions from other files and use a while-loop menu to run different activities based on the user’s input. [activity25.py](activity25.py)
- Activity 26: Creating a dictionary in Python like bros = {'py': 'java', 'perl': 'c++'}. [activity26.py](activity26.py)
- Activity 27: Create and update a dictionary , printing its contents, and search for specific keys using functions and a user input loop. [activity27.py](activity27.py)
- Activity 28: Installing a Python Snake game teaches you Python basics, using pygame, game loops, and handling user input. [activity28.py](activity28.py)
